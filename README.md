# Geospatial Analytics Extension for KNIME

This repository is the home of the [Geospatial Analytics Extension](https://hub.knime.com/spatialdatalab/extensions/sdl.harvard.features.geospatial/latest) for [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform). The extension provides a set of nodes for spatial data analysis and visualization.

The extension is developed by the [Center for Geographic Analysis](https://gis.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) and [KNIME](https://www.knime.com/) as part of a two-year project of the [Spatiotemporal Innovation Center](https://www.stcenter.net/). The goal of the collaboration is to develop KNIME Analytics Platform extensions and best-practice workflows to provide a consistent and compatible platform for spatial data analysis across disciplines. 

The extension is mainly based on the [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/) library and the [PySAL](https://pysal.org/) library. The data types are defined in the 
[KNIME - Geospatial Data Types](https://github.com/knime/knime-geospatial) extension.


## Installation

### KNIME Analytics Platform

The extension can be installed via the [KNIME Hub](https://hub.knime.com/spatialdatalab/extensions/sdl.harvard.features.geospatial/latest) by dragging and doping or installed like any other KNIME extension via the KNIME Extension Manager.


If you want to test the latest version you can follow the instructions in the Setup section of the [Contribution guide](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-geospatial-extension/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#setup).

### KNIME Business Hub
To setup a KNIME Executor with the Geospatial Extension follow this [guide.](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-geospatial-extension/blob/main/docs/geospatial-install.md)
In order to use the Geospatial Views in your DataApps you have to adapt the security policies as described [here.](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-geospatial-extension/blob/main/docs/geospatialViewsWebPortal.md)

## Usage

[Here are some examples of workflows](https://hub.knime.com/center%20for%20geographic%20analysis%20at%20harvard%20university/spaces/Geospatial%20Analytics%20Examples/latest/~ieq2yfgeQUshNTi-/) that use the extension. You can also find some videos on the [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jz-YIGMsKM&list=PLnFUy1r9kH-20dWQGVKKiUAOlbPGxyBUv).

If you want to use the Geospatial Views in a KNIME Data App please have a look at this [guide](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-geospatial-extension/blob/main/docs/geospatialViewsWebPortal.md).

## How to Contribute

### Package Organization

* `knime_extension`: This folder contains all files of the KNIME Geospatial extension such as the source code of each node. The folder itself is structured as suggested in the Python Best Practices file.
* `docs`: Additional material to get you started with the development of this extension such as development setup instructions or best practices.
* `tests`: Test data and workflows used to test the node functionality.
* `config.yml`: Example `config.yml` file that should point to the `knime_extension` folder on your local hard drive during local development and debugging as described [here](https://docs.knime.com/latest/pure_python_node_extensions_guide/index.html#tutorial-writing-first-py-node).
